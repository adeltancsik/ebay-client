# E-bay clone - Client

## What this project is about

An individual project made during my studies, practicing how to create a full-stack app from scratch.

This is an E-bay clone application's client side, where a registered user can access the site's features, which are:

- creating new advertisments with title, description, picture URL, and the advertiser's contact infos
- edit and delete existing advertisments

* **[Server](https://github.com/adeltancsik/ebay-server)**
  Contains the end points and database models.
